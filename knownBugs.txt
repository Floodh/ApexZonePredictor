1:
    The program does not close files properly when loading .png files.
    This can cause crashes when tryng to save a .png file with the same name twice.
    Or prevent me from saving a .png file when the program is running.
    Very annoying, seems to be the constructor for Bitmap class that's the problem.

2:
    The edge vector has a incorrect length.
