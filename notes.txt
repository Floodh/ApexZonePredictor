Unconfirmed:
    -   The final zone pull will pull in the oposite direction of the first(or the second???) zone pull.
        Unless its a counter pull, in which case it will probaly pull in the same direction.
    -   Unknown if building with OOB timmers counts towards invalid play area.

Confirmed:

    -   If the zone is pulling towards an invalid location. Its a garanteed counter pull.
        50% of the zone needs to be playable and the final zone will need to adjust to banned zones data.
        
    -   People don't know that much about the zone. The only thing that seems to be common knowledge is:
            1:  Zone generly keeps pulling in the same direction.
            2:  Similar zones will have similar zone pulls.
            3:  The Datamined stuff to rule out certain zones.
        There are also some misconceptions:
            1:  You can't predict the final zone from the first ring.
            2:  "I have had this zone before", no you did not, you just had a zone that ended on almost exactly the same spot. Which is good enough, but still.
