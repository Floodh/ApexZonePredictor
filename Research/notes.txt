Unconfirmed:
    -   The final zone pull will pull in the oposite direction of the first(or the second???) zone pull.
        Unless its a counter pull, in which case it will probaly pull in the same direction.
    -   Unknown if building with OOB timmers counts towards invalid play area.

Confirmed:

    -   If the zone is pulling towards an invalid location. Its a garanteed counter pull.
        50% of the zone needs to be playable and the final zone will need to adjust to banned zones data.
        
    -   People don't know that much about the zone. The only thing that seems to be common knowledge is:
            1:  Zone generly keeps pulling in the same direction.
            2:  Similar zones will have similar zone pulls.
            3:  The Datamined stuff to rule out certain zones.
        There are also some misconceptions:
            1:  You can't predict the final zone from the first ring.
            2:  "I have had this zone before", no you did not, you just had a zone that ended almost exactly in the same spot. Which is good enough, but still.


Zone patterns:
    -   Fishhook

    -   Half pull 45 degrees inwards.

        If:
            1: First ring is half pull
            2: 2nd ring has to pull inwards, 45 degrees should be the angle between Mid to R1 and Mid to R2
            3: Unconfirmed: The rings needs to almost be colliding with each other.

        When true:
            The zone will start pulling in a half moon pattern, and it will gradually start pulling into a dnougnut pattern.
            Unconfirmed: Zones that ends close to invalid end zone locations are more likely to have this zone pattern. (South Lava Siphon tunnel)


    -   Mimic
        If:
            ???
            Ring are touching while lacking other indicators for hard pulls.
        
        When true:
            3rd circle will hard pull to where the inne triangle is pointing.
            the 4th will counter pull halfway back towards the 2nd circle
            the 5th and final pull will be towards the center of the map perpendicular to the 2 most recent pulls
